# Predictive Surge Pricing System

## Overview

The Predictive Surge Pricing System is designed to dynamically adjust pricing based on real-time demand and supply conditions. It leverages a combination of real-time data processing, machine learning, and scalable infrastructure to provide accurate surge pricing predictions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Utilizes Kafka and Flink for handling high-throughput event streams.
- **Machine Learning**: Integrates a PyTorch model for surge prediction.
- **GraphQL API**: Provides a flexible API for querying surge forecasts and historical data.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Deployed on AWS ECS with auto-scaling capabilities.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Includes Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for comprehensive monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Go** (version 1.18 or later)
- **Python** (version 3.6 or later)
- **Terraform** (if managing infrastructure)
